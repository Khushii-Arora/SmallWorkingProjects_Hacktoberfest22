# Pig-Game

## Rules:

- You have to roll the dice, the number you get will be added to your "current score".
- If you roll a "1", your current score will become zero and it will be your opponent's turn.
- "Hold your score" to save it to total score but then the next turn would go to the opponent.
- Whoever scores 100 first wins
